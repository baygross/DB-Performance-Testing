Abstract
This paper investigates the relative performance of four representative database systems under the simulated workload of a modern class of web applications.  Specifically, we modeled our test suite on the expected high-volume low-contention workload behind many popular “read heavy” web applications such as Twitter, or Tumblr. The database systems tested were IBM’s DB2, PostgreSQL, HBase, and MongoDB, and each of these DBMS was installed “out of the box.”
